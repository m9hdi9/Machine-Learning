Problem Definition

Problem Type: Classification.

Reason: The goal is to categorize patients into discrete classes (e.g., presence or absence of heart disease) rather than predicting a continuous numerical value.

Target Variable: Diagnosis (The column representing the presence of heart disease).

Problem Description: The model is expected to learn how to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on their physiological attributes, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical indicators.
